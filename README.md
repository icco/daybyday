# Day By Day

This is for me to view my life "Day by Day". 

Below is a bit of a brain dump from prior to coding.

## Why

I personally output a lot of data. Whether it's to Twitter, Flickr, Last.FM, <strike>del.icio.us</strike>Pinboard, or something else, I leak more data than my washing machine leaks water (and it never stops filling up). I want to make a system that runs and gives me information about a certain day. I want to cache all of those API requests, so I don't do them a ton, and so I can have a database of the API responses. I also want to know what data I have put out so far today.

## Design

Alright so let's go through some basic features we want.

### APIs

Definitely

 * Last.FM
 * Twitter

Probably:

 * RSS - pull in links to blog posts.
 * Flickr

Maybe:

 * GitHub - Made x commits today in x projects

### Page layout

I want something that feels like a "here is what I did today" kind of thing. It should probably try and pull in a picture of the user, it'd be nice if gravatar kept a history, but I don't think they do. Maybe in the config file I can list images appropriate for time periods.

## Installation
